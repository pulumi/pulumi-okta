    /// This resource allows you to create and configure a sign-on policy rule for the application.
    /// 
    /// A default or `Catch-all Rule` sign-on policy rule can be imported and managed as a custom rule.
    /// The only difference is that these fields are immutable and can not be managed: `network_connection`, `network_excludes`,
    /// `network_includes`, `platform_include`, `custom_expression`, `device_is_registered`, `device_is_managed`, `users_excluded`,
    /// `users_included`, `groups_excluded`, `groups_included`, `user_types_excluded` and `user_types_included`.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ### Rule with Constraints
