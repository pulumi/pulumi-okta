/**
 * Resource to manage a set of memberships for a specific group.
 * This resource will allow you to bulk manage group membership in Okta for a given
 * group. This offers an interface to pass multiple users into a single resource
 * call, for better API resource usage. If you need a relationship of a single
 * user to many groups, please use the 'okta_user_group_memberships' resource.
 * **Important**: The default behavior of the resource is to only maintain the
 * state of user ids that are assigned it. This behavior will signal drift only if
 * those users stop being part of the group. If the desired behavior is track all
 * users that are added/removed from the group make use of the 'track_all_users'
 * argument with this resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as okta from "@pulumi/okta";
 *
 * const test = new okta.group.Group("test", {
 *     name: "testAcc_replace_with_uuid",
 *     description: "testing, testing",
 * });
 * const testGroupMemberships = new okta.GroupMemberships("test", {
 *     groupId: test.id,
 *     users: [
 *         test1.id,
 *         test2.id,
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * an Okta Group's memberships can be imported via the Okta group ID.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import okta:index/groupMemberships:GroupMemberships test <group_id>
 * ```
 *
 * optional parameter track all users will also import all user id currently assigned to the group
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import okta:index/groupMemberships:GroupMemberships test <group_id>/<true>
 * ```
