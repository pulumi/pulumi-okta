/**
 * Resource to manage a set of memberships for a specific group.
 *
 * This resource will allow you to bulk manage group membership in Okta for a given
 * group. This offers an interface to pass multiple users into a single resource
 * call, for better API resource usage. If you need a relationship of a single
 * user to many groups, please use the `okta.UserGroupMemberships` resource.
 *
 * **Important**: The default behavior of the resource is to only maintain the
 * state of user ids that are assigned it. This behavior will signal drift only if
 * those users stop being part of the group. If the desired behavior is track all
 * users that are added/removed from the group make use of the `trackAllUsers`
 * argument with this resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as okta from "@pulumi/okta";
 *
 * const testGroup = new okta.group.Group("testGroup", {description: "testing, testing"});
 * const testGroupMemberships = new okta.GroupMemberships("testGroupMemberships", {
 *     groupId: testGroup.id,
 *     users: [
 *         okta_user.test1.id,
 *         okta_user.test2.id,
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * an Okta Group's memberships can be imported via the Okta group ID.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import okta:index/groupMemberships:GroupMemberships test &#60;group id&#62;
 * ```
 *
 *  optional parameter track all users will also import all user id currently assigned to the group
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import okta:index/groupMemberships:GroupMemberships test &#60;group id&#62;/&#60;true&#62;
 * ```
