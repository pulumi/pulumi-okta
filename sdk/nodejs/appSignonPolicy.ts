/**
 * Manages a sign-on policy.
 *
 * > **WARNING:** This feature is only available as a part of the Okta Identity
 * Engine (OIE) and ***is not*** compatible with Classic orgs. Authentication
 * policies for applications in a Classic org can only be modified in the Admin UI,
 * there isn't a public API for this. Therefore the Okta Terraform Provider does
 * not support this resource for Classic orgs. Contact
 * support for further information.
 * This resource allows you to create and configure a sign-on policy for the
 * application. Inside the product a sign-on policy is referenced as an
 * _authentication policy_, in the public API the policy is of type
 * ['ACCESS_POLICY'](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/policy/#policy-object).
 * A newly created app's sign-on policy will always contain the default
 * authentication policy unless one is assigned via 'authentication_policy' in the
 * app resource. At the API level the default policy has system property value of
 * true.
 * **WARNING:** When this policy is destroyed any other applications that
 * associate the policy as their authentication policy will be reassigned to the
 * default/system access policy.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import okta:index/appSignonPolicy:AppSignonPolicy example <policy_id>
 * ```
