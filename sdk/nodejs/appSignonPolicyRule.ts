/**
 * Manages a sign-on policy rules for the application.
 *
 * > **WARNING:** This feature is only available as a part of the Identity Engine. Contact support for further information.
 *
 * > **WARNING:** When managing multiple `okta.AppSignonPolicyRule` resources with concurrent operations, the Okta API may encounter concurrency issues. While this provider implements internal locking to prevent conflicts within a single Terraform process, you should use explicit `dependsOn` references between rules to ensure proper sequencing, especially when managing rule priorities.
 *
 * This resource allows you to create and configure a sign-on policy rule for the application.
 * A default or 'Catch-all Rule' sign-on policy rule can be imported and managed as a custom rule.
 * The only difference is that these fields are immutable and can not be managed: 'network_connection', 'network_excludes',
 * 'network_includes', 'platform_include', 'custom_expression', 'device_is_registered', 'device_is_managed', 'users_excluded',
 * 'users_included', 'groups_excluded', 'groups_included', 'user_types_excluded' and 'user_types_included'.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import okta:index/appSignonPolicyRule:AppSignonPolicyRule example <policy_id>/<rule_id>
 * ```
